To visualize the Kubernetes Metrics, you can use following pre-built Dashboards:

- [K8s Infra Metrics](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/tree/main/k8s-infra-metrics)

You should copy the JSON data in these files and create a New Dashboard in the Dashboard Tab of SigNoz.

By following the previous step, you should also be able to see Kubernetes Pod logs in the logs Section of SigNoz.

To send traces for your application deployed on your Kubernetes cluster, checkout the Application monitoring section of onboarding.
