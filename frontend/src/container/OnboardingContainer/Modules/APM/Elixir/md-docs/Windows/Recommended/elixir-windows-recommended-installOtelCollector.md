## Setup OpenTelemetry Binary as an agent
&nbsp;

### Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz

&nbsp;

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v{{OTEL_VERSION}}/otelcol-contrib_{{OTEL_VERSION}}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
&nbsp;

### Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the `otelcol-contrib` folder

&nbsp;

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_{{OTEL_VERSION}}_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```
&nbsp;

### Step 3: Create config.yaml in folder otelcol-contrib with the below content in it

&nbsp;
