# 1. General Instructions üìù

## 1.1 For Creating Issue(s)
Before making any significant changes and before filing a new issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), or [recently closed](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. 

**Issue Types** - [Bug Report](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) | [Feature Request](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) | [Performance Issue Report](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=performance-issue-report.md&title=) | [Request Dashboard](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dashboard-template&projects=&template=request_dashboard.md&title=%5BDashboard+Request%5D+) | [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/security/policy)

#### Details like these are incredibly useful:

- **Requirement** - what kind of use case are you trying to solve?
- **Proposal** - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing
  situation?
- Any open questions to address‚ùì

#### If you are reporting a bug, details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps.
- The version of our code being used.
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bugüêû.
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment.

## 1.2 For Pull Request(s)

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Once the approach is agreed upon ‚úÖ, make your changes and open a Pull Request(s). 
Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that,

- Fork the SigNoz repo on GitHub, clone it on your machine.
- Create a branch with your changes.
- You are working against the latest source on the `develop` branch.
- Modify the source; please focus only on the specific change you are contributing.
- Ensure local tests pass.
- Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
- Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
- Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation
- Once you've pushed your commits to GitHub, make sure that your branch can be auto-merged (there are no merge conflicts). If not, on your computer, merge main into your branch, resolve any merge conflicts, make sure everything still runs correctly and passes all the tests, and then push up those changes.
- Once the change has been approved and merged, we will inform you in a comment.


GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and 
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

**Note:** Unless your change is small, **please** consider submitting different Pull Request(s):

* 1Ô∏è‚É£ First PR should include the overall structure of the new component:
  * Readme, configuration, interfaces or base classes, etc...
  * This PR is usually trivial to review, so the size limit does not apply to
    it.
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second PR should include the concrete implementation of the component. If the
  size of this PR is larger than the recommended size, consider **splitting** ‚öîÔ∏è it into
  multiple PRs.
* If there are multiple sub-component then ideally each one should be implemented as
  a **separate** pull request.
* Last PR should include changes to **any user-facing documentation.** And should include
  end-to-end tests if applicable. The component must be enabled
  only after sufficient testing, and there is enough confidence in the
  stability and quality of the component.


You can always reach out to `ankit@signoz.io` to understand more about the repo and product. We are very responsive over email and [slack community](https://signoz.io/slack).

# 3. Develop Frontend üåö

**Need to Update: [https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/tree/develop/frontend](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/tree/develop/frontend)**

Also, have a look at [Frontend README.md](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/frontend/README.md) sections for more info on how to setup SigNoz frontend locally (with and without Docker).

## 3.1 Contribute to Frontend with Docker installation of SigNoz

- Clone the SigNoz repository and cd into signoz directory,
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git && cd signoz
  ```
- Comment out `frontend` service section at [`deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L68`](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L68)

![develop-frontend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52788043/179009217-6692616b-17dc-4d27-b587-9d007098d739.jpeg)


- run `cd deploy` to move to deploy directory,
- Install signoz locally **without** the frontend,
    - Add / Uncomment the below configuration to query-service section at [`deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L47`](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L47)
    ```
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    ```
<img width="869" alt="query service" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52788043/179010251-8489be31-04ca-42f8-b30d-ef0bb6accb6b.png">    
    
  - Next run,
    ```
    sudo docker-compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```
- `cd ../frontend` and change baseURL in file [`frontend/src/constants/env.ts#L2`](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/frontend/src/constants/env.ts#L2) and for that, you need to create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the following environment variable (`FRONTEND_API_ENDPOINT`) matching your configuration.

    If you have backend api exposed via frontend nginx:
    ```
    FRONTEND_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3301
    ```
    If not:
    ```
    FRONTEND_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080
    ```

- Next, 
  ```
  yarn install
  yarn dev
  ```

### Important Notes:
The Maintainers / Contributors who will change Line Numbers of `Frontend` & `Query-Section`, please update line numbers in [`/.scripts/commentLinesForSetup.sh`](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/.scripts/commentLinesForSetup.sh)

 **[`^top^`](#contributing-guidelines)**

## 3.2 Contribute to Frontend without installing SigNoz backend

If you don't want to install the SigNoz backend just for doing frontend development, we can provide you with test environments that you can use as the backend. 

- Clone the SigNoz repository and cd into signoz/frontend directory,
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git && cd signoz/frontend
  ````
- Create a file `.env` in the `frontend` directory with `FRONTEND_API_ENDPOINT=<test environment URL>`
- Next, 
  ```
  yarn install
  yarn dev
  ```

Please ping us in the [`#contributing`](https://signoz-community.slack.com/archives/C01LWQ8KS7M) channel or ask `@Prashant Shahi` in our [Slack Community](https://signoz.io/slack)  and we will DM you with `<test environment URL>`.

**Frontend should now be accessible at** [`http://localhost:3301/services`](http://localhost:3301/services)

# 4. Contribute to Backend (Query-Service) üåë

**Need to Update: [https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/tree/develop/pkg/query-service](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/tree/develop/pkg/query-service)**

## 4.1 Prerequisites

### 4.1.1 Install SQLite3

- Run `sqlite3` command to check if you already have SQLite3 installed on your machine.

- If not installed already, Install using below command
  - on Linux
    - on Debian / Ubuntu
      ```
        sudo apt install sqlite3
      ```
    - on CentOS / Fedora / RedHat
      ```
        sudo yum install sqlite3
      ```

## 4.2 To run ClickHouse setup (recommended for local development)

- Clone the SigNoz repository and cd into signoz directory,
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git && cd signoz
    ```
- run `sudo make dev-setup` to configure local setup to run query-service,
- Comment out `frontend` service section at [`deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L68`](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L68)
<img width="982" alt="develop-frontend" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52788043/179043977-012be8b0-a2ed-40d1-b2e6-2ab72d7989c0.png">

- Comment out `query-service` section at [`deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L41`,](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml#L41)
<img width="1068" alt="Screenshot 2022-07-14 at 22 48 07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52788043/179044151-a65ba571-db0b-4a16-b64b-ca3fadcf3af0.png">

- add below configuration to `clickhouse` section at [`deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml`,](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml)
  ```
  ports:
    - 9001:9000
  ```
<img width="1013" alt="Screenshot 2022-07-14 at 22 50 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52788043/179044544-a293d3bc-4c4f-49ea-a276-505a381de67d.png">

- run `cd pkg/query-service/` to move to `query-service` directory,
- Then, you need to create a `.env` file with the following environment variable 
    ```
    SIGNOZ_LOCAL_DB_PATH="./signoz.db"
    ```
to set your local environment with the right `RELATIONAL_DATASOURCE_PATH` as mentioned in [`./constants/constants.go#L38`,](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/pkg/query-service/constants/constants.go#L38)

- Now, install SigNoz locally **without** the `frontend` and `query-service`,
  - If you are using `x86_64` processors (All Intel/AMD processors) run `sudo make run-x86`
  - If you are on `arm64` processors (Apple M1 Macs) run `sudo make run-arm`

#### Run locally,
```
ClickHouseUrl=tcp://localhost:9001 STORAGE=clickhouse go run main.go
```

#### Build and Run locally
```
cd pkg/query-service
go build -o build/query-service main.go
ClickHouseUrl=tcp://localhost:9001 STORAGE=clickhouse build/query-service
```

#### Docker Images
The docker images of query-service is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/signoz/query-service

```
docker pull signoz/query-service
```

```
docker pull signoz/query-service:latest
```

```
docker pull signoz/query-service:develop
```

### Important Note:
The Maintainers / Contributors who will change Line Numbers of `Frontend` & `Query-Section`, please update line numbers in [`/.scripts/commentLinesForSetup.sh`](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/.scripts/commentLinesForSetup.sh)



**Query Service should now be available at** [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

If you want to see how the frontend plays with query service, you can run the frontend also in your local env with the baseURL changed to `http://localhost:8080` in file [`frontend/src/constants/env.ts`](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/develop/frontend/src/constants/env.ts) as the `query-service` is now running at port `8080`.

<!-- Instead of configuring a local setup, you can also use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), a VSCode-based Web IDE.

Click the button below. A workspace with all required environments will be created.
