# This example is practical application of a 3-pipeline configuration for
# writing to a remote prometheus-compatible write endpoint.
#
# The spanmetrics processor will output data on every span batch that is received,
# that could overwhelm the remote write endpoint.
#
# Therefore, a good pattern to follow is to ratelimit the metrics coming out of
# spanmetrics by adding a prometheus exporter (to expose these metrics as snapshots)
# and a prometheus receiver to scrape these snapshots at a controlled interval,
# passing these scraped metrics onto the prometheusremotewrite exporter.
#
# The added benefit of this pattern is that it provides a regular "heartbeat" of
# datapoints that prevents gaps in the timeseries.
