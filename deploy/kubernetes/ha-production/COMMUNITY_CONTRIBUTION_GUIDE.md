## 📝 GitHub Issue Templates

### Issue #1: Schema Migration Fails in HA Deployments
```markdown
**Bug Report: Schema Migration Topology Mismatch**

**Problem**: SigNoz Helm chart hardcodes schema migration for single-node (1 shard, 1 replica), causing failures in distributed ClickHouse deployments.

**Environment**:
- SigNoz version: v0.90.1
- Kubernetes: 1.31 (AWS EKS)
- ClickHouse: 2 shards × 2 replicas

**Expected Behavior**: Schema migration should work with distributed ClickHouse clusters

**Actual Behavior**: 
- Migration fails with "expected shard count: 1, current shard count: 0"
- Databases not created (missing signoz_traces, signoz_metrics, etc.)
- SigNoz UI shows 500 errors

**Solution Provided**: Custom schema migration job with correct topology parameters

**Impact**: Prevents HA deployments entirely - CRITICAL issue for production use
```

### Issue #2: Service Name Conflicts During Upgrades
```markdown
**Bug Report: ClickHouse Service Name Conflicts**

**Problem**: Helm upgrades create duplicate ClickHouse installations with different service names, breaking connectivity and causing data ingestion failures.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Deploy SigNoz HA with existing ClickHouse cluster
2. Run `helm upgrade signoz signoz/signoz`
3. New installation creates `signoz-clickhouse` service
4. Existing cluster uses `clickhouse-signoz-clickhouse-ha` service
5. Services try to connect to wrong/deleted service

**Expected Behavior**: Upgrade should maintain service connectivity

**Actual Behavior**: 
- SigNoz UI loads but shows no data
- OTel collectors can't connect to ClickHouse
- Manual patching required after every upgrade

**Solution Provided**: Permanent service name configuration in Helm values

**Impact**: Requires manual intervention after every upgrade - HIGH priority

## 🧪 Testing Strategy for Contributors

### Before Submitting PR
1. **Fresh Deployment Test**
   ```bash
   # Test complete deployment from scratch
   helm install signoz signoz/signoz -n signoz -f signoz-ha-production-values.yaml
   ```

2. **Upgrade Test**
   ```bash
   # Test upgrade preserves configuration  
   helm upgrade signoz signoz/signoz -n signoz -f signoz-ha-production-values.yaml
   ```

3. **Data Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify data ingestion works
   kubectl exec chi-signoz-clickhouse-ha-prod-0-0-0 -n signoz -- \
     clickhouse-client -q "SELECT count(*) FROM signoz_metrics.distributed_samples_v4"
   ```

### Test Environments
- **Minimum**: 3-node Kubernetes cluster
- **Recommended**: Cloud-managed Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS)
- **Storage**: 1TB+ per ClickHouse pod
- **Monitoring**: Verify ingestion for 30+ minutes

## 🤝 Community Engagement

### Discussion Points for PR
1. **File Organization**: Where should HA configs live?
2. **Cloud Provider**: Should we add GCP/Azure variants?
3. **Chart Integration**: Merge with main values or keep separate?
4. **Documentation**: Integrate with existing docs or standalone?

### Expected Questions
1. **"Why not improve the main chart instead?"**
   - Answer: This provides immediate solution while chart improvements take time
   - Shows working example for chart enhancements

2. **"Is this too AWS-specific?"**  
   - Answer: Core config is cloud-agnostic, only ALB/EBS are AWS-specific
   - Easy to adapt for other cloud providers

3. **"Should this be an operator instead?"**
   - Answer: Helm-based approach is more accessible and maintainable
   - Operator could be future enhancement

### Contribution Timeline
1. **Week 1**: Submit issues and initial PR
2. **Week 2**: Address review feedback, add requested features
3. **Week 3**: Final refinements, documentation improvements
4. **Week 4**: Merge and follow-up improvements
